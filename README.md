## ⚡ How It Works

1. A random sentence appears on the screen.
2. Start typing in the input box.
3. The app tracks:

   * **Speed (WPM)** → total words typed per minute.
   * **Accuracy (%)** → correct characters vs total characters.
4. Incorrect characters are highlighted in **red**.
5. Once the sentence is completed → results are shown.
6. You can **restart** anytime to practice again.
